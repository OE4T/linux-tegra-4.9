NVIDIA Tegra APE aux CPU, with communication via the "IVC" IPC protocol.

APE is an aux CPU which talks to CCPLEX over IVC.

Its assumed that the APE FW implements IVC, and uses HSP DB IRQs as part of IVC.
Its also assumed that the APE FW expects AST regions 0/1/2 are already set up
for the APE to access FW in DRAM, SYSRAM if applicable, and the IVC memory.

== APE top-level node ==

The APE core is represented by the top-level node including direct HW resources
such as clocks, resets etc.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra186-ape-ivc" for T18x.
- nvidia,hsp-notifications: <HSP-phandle HSP-ID HSP-DB>
  * HSP is a set of HW synchronization primitives used in Tegra to allow
    multiple processors to share resources and communicate together.
  * HSP-ID is NVIDIA Tegra HSP unique ID for APE, used in IPC.
  * HSP-DB is NVIDIA Tegra HSP unique doorbell number allotted to APE.
    A HSP doorbell allows a set of source agents in Tegra to request the
    attention of specified target agent. In general the agents are processors
    and doorbell used as part of an IPC protocol.
  * For more HSP details, refer: ../tegra-hsp.txt.
- reg: Address entries (APE BASE)
  Formatted as per standard rules for this property.
- nvidia,ast: APE AST0 and APE AST1 phandles
  For details refer: ../tegra-ast.txt
- #address-cells: Number of address cells in subnodes (ivc-channels).
  Should be set to <1>.
- #size-cells: Number of size cells in subnodes (ivc-channels).
  Should be set to <1>.
- clocks: Should contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Names of the clocks required by APE.
  Must include following entries:
  - ahub
  - apb2ape
  - ape
  - adsp
  - adspneon
- resets: Should contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Names of the resets required for APE.
  Must include following entries:
  - adspdbg
  - adspintf
  - adspneon
  - adspperiph
  - adspscu
  - adspwdt
  - ape
  - adsp

Mailbox properties:
- #mbox-cells
  Should be set to <1>.

The IVC channels are represented as mailbox channels.
Hence, this binding uses the mailbox binding at ../mailbox/mailbox.txt.

== APE sub nodes ==

* ivc-channels

Contains a sub-node for each IVC channel implemented by the APE.
For IVC channel details, please refer: ../tegra-ivc-channel.txt
