Subject: [PATCH 352/353] kernel/printk: Don't try to print from IRQ/NMI
 (again)

Similar to patch "kernel/printk: Don't try to print from IRQ/NMI
region", make changes to downstream added code as well:

On -RT we try to acquire sleeping locks which might lead to warnings
from lockdep or a warn_on() from spin_try_lock() (which is a rtmutex on
RT).
We don't print in general from a IRQ off region so we should not try
this via console_unblank() / bust_spinlocks() as well.
